# beta_bursts
General scripts and functions for time-domain analysis of beta bursts/events.

STILL WORK IN PROGRESS

Supposed to do the following:
1. Find beta events in continous time-series (e.g. resting state)
2. Find beta events in event-related time-series.

## Status of development:
* Finding beta events in continous time-series (1) implemented for resting state (i.e. continous data) in _PD_beta_burst_ project soon to be published (still a private repo). Scripts are still specific to this project.
* Finding beta events for event related data is somewhat implemented but not properly tested on real data.
* Supports methods for defining thresholds based on Shin et al. and Little et al. - add more if appropriate.
